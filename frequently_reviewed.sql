--In frequently_reviewed.sql, write a SQL statement to create a view named
--frequently_reviewed.This view should contain the 100 most frequently
--reviewed listings, sorted from most- to least-frequently reviewed.
--Ensure the view contains the following columns:

--id, which is the id of the listing from the listings table.
--property_type, from the listings table.
--host_name, from the listings table.
--reviews, which is the number of reviews the listing has received.

--If any two listings have the same number of reviews, sort by property_type (in alphabetical order), followed by host_name (in alphabetical order).
